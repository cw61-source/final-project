# 📝 Task Manager API

A simple task management REST API built with FastAPI for my backend course final project. It stores tasks in a plain text file using JSON Lines format, includes a small frontend UI, and can be deployed for free on Render.


## What it does

- Create, read, update and delete tasks (CRUD)
- Filter tasks by completion status
- See stats like total tasks and completion percentage
- Data stays saved even after restarting the server (stored in `tasks.txt`)
- Comes with a simple browser frontend

## How to run it locally

**1. Clone the repo**
`bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Start the server**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**4. Open in browser**

## API Endpoints

| Method | URL | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Check if API is running |
| GET | `/tasks` | Get all tasks |
| GET | `/tasks?completed=true` | Filter by completion status |
| GET | `/tasks/{id}` | Get a single task |
| POST | `/tasks` | Create a new task |
| PUT | `/tasks/{id}` | Update a task |
| DELETE | `/tasks/{id}` | Delete one task |
| DELETE | `/tasks` | Delete all tasks |
| GET | `/tasks/stats` | Get summary stats |

### Example: Creating a task

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Learn FastAPI", "description": "Watch the tutorials"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Learn FastAPI",
  "description": "Watch the tutorials",
  "completed": false
}
```

## How tasks are stored

Each task is saved as one JSON object per line in `tasks.txt`:

```
{"id": 1, "title": "Learn FastAPI", "description": "Watch tutorials", "completed": false}
{"id": 2, "title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk and eggs", "completed": true}
```

This is called JSON Lines format. It's simple, human-readable, and easy to parse.

## Deploying to Render (free)

1. Push your code to a public GitHub repository
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create a free account
3. Click **New → Web Service**
4. Connect your GitHub repo
5. Render will detect `render.yaml` automatically and configure everything
6. Click **Deploy**


## Next steps / ideas

- **Add PostgreSQL** – Replace the text file with a real database. Render offers a free PostgreSQL instance you can connect with SQLModel or SQLAlchemy.
- **Add React frontend** – Replace the basic HTML frontend with a proper React app.
- **Add user authentication** – Use JWT tokens so each user has their own tasks.
- **Add due dates** – Extend the task model with a `due_date` field and sort by urgency.
